                     A <b>Virtual Medical Scribe</b> is a professional who documents the patient’s encounter remotely for the physician in the USA. This usually involves working in real-time as the scribe connects to the doctor’s office while the doctor is performing a procedure or examination on a patient or simply attending to a patient inside his office. The scribe can view and listen to the proceedings and must meticulously enter all the relevant data directly into the HER (Electronic health record).

                     Each clinician is individually paired with a dedicated, remote scribe who listens to each encounter and enters the encounter narrative into your EMR in real-time.  The scribe has to be well versed in medical terminology, drug names, and also be computer savvy to quickly enter details while the doctor is attending to the patient. He must be quick and not miss out on any critical data, as it all happens in real-time. Ability to comprehend and good writing abilities all come handy.

                      <b>Real-time clinical documentation reduces administrative burden and clinician burn-out</b>. While EMRs (Electronic medical records) have become an important tool, the administrative burden has become an issue. In fact, a recently published study showed that for every hour clinicians spend with a patient, they add nearly TWO ADDITIONAL HOURS of EMR and desk time, resulting in:
